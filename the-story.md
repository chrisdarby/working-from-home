# The long winded monologue about the challenges of working from home full time during the apocolypse that could probably have been summed up in a few bullet points
### By Chris Darby
 

#### Who Am I
My name is Chris Darby, I work in CIS at Durham University as an IS Specialist, I’m one of the people you call when the website breaks, the CMS isn’t playing ball, you need a new whizz-bang app to do something fancy, or your online apps just don’t want to work.

I’ve only been with Durham University for a few months, since October 2019, but have been a professional web developer since 1997.

My career has had me working for development studios in both Australia and the UK, and working on everything from small business websites, mobile apps, development for charitable causes, applications and websites for educational institutions such as Murdoch University in Western Australia, and large scale enterprise applications and websites for private corporate clients and government departments and everything in between.

Oh, I also know that I can waffle on, at great length, whether you want me to or not… so my apologies if this is really way too long...


#### Why I Know What I’m Talking About

My position previous to coming to the University had me working from home full time for 3 years, when I first started back in September 2016, I saw only the positives, eyes sparkling at the flexibility and freedom I was about to have, the joys of no longer having to commute to work meaning I could sleep that little bit later, however, I didn’t anticipate the challenges that came with working from home full time, my wife did, she warned me, repeatedly, but I didn’t listen.

My wife works in Mental Health with the NHS, she talked to me about routine and keeping a home and work life balance and how to maintain connection and communication with people, but again, I didn’t listen, I was too wrapped up in how great this was going to be and how wonderful it would be for everyone, that I just didn’t fully see what the challenges could be.

I am aware that not everyone is going to have issue with working from home, a lot of you will do quite well, and this document won’t apply to everyone, it may apply to no-one, but i’d wager that many of you, whom have possibly never worked from home, are going to struggle to stay focused, are going to struggle to not get distracted, are going to struggle with potential isolation and loneliness if you’re in the house alone all day, or are going to struggle to keep a routine, I know I did...

Despite spending many years working on freelance projects from home, the occasional afternoon from home and tinkering in the evenings with my own private projects, switching to working from home full time definitely required a lot of unexpected adjustment.

But don’t get me wrong, working home was great, it really was, the flexibility and freedom was amazing, but I won’t sugarcoat it working from home was also very frustrating, draining, and emotionally challenging, my wife will be the first to shout out loud how much of a nightmare I was at times.

So let’s talk about it and discuss some strategies...


#### What Working From Home Is Like

For me, it was equal amounts relaxing, isolating, frustrating, lonely, productive and flexible, although this isn’t going to be the case for a lot of people, particularly because when I worked for home, my wife was at work and for the majority of the time the kids were at school, at the moment a lot of you will have kids at home or your partner also working from home.

Working from home gave me a huge amount of flexibility, despite a few teething issues at the start with getting into routine, which we’ll get to later, I could manage the kids and school pickups (not so much an issue at the moment), walk the dog, take a break when I needed, sleep in a little later because there was no commute.

Once I got properly into the swing of things, my productivity massively increased, once I was able to get into routine, I found I could get quite a lot done in my work day, at times completing more than I would in an office and in less time.

As I mentioned, for a lot of people during this pandemic, isolation and loneliness won’t be an issue as kids and spouses will probably also be at home, however the opposite also has its challenges.

Having spent 3 years working from home, it means I was also working from home during school holidays and some days when my wife was at home, taking time off to spend with the kids.

While isolation and loneliness had its drawbacks, equally, kids at home, a full house, arguments from the kids because they’re bouncing off the wall and constant distraction also had a big effect on maintaining that balance.

So, where do I begin…

#### Your Work Day Routine

It is absolutely important, and I cannot stress this enough, it is absolutely one of the most important things, that you set in place a proper work routine, a no-brainer right?

Thats what I thought…

What is necessary, is a proper routine, with a set start and end time, defined breaks, a set lunch time, and a well defined routine. This doesn’t mean make things so rigid that you lock yourself down and end up going nuts.

If you started work in the office at 9am, then start in your home office at 9am

If you finished at 4pm, then finish at 4pm and don’t stray beyond that. If you took lunch at 12:30pm, then stop, step away from the computer and take lunch for an hour at 12:30pm.

Not only does this give your work day structure to work with, but it also means that you don’t end up getting into the non-routine of starting the work day later and later, or finishing earlier than you would normally and end up getting behind in work, or not realising until 3pm that you haven’t had lunch yet because you’ve been focused on a task. Or worst of all, not setting a defined finish time, so you end up still sitting there at 8pm working on just one more report, or tinkering with a bit of code, or trying to solve problems at 10pm, 5 hours after you were supposed to finish.

Getting into that sort of routine, particularly those who are dedicated to finishing a task, can quickly lead to being overworked and burnt out, having your home life suffer and not being able to separate the two. 

Setting in a routine at the start, and sticking to it as best as possible, also massively helps when in a few months time going back into the the office. I know from experience that if you have a routine (or lack thereof) that is out of whack, such as sleeping in late and then working late, or getting busy towards the end of the day and working into the evening, your body really does get used to this work life, and getting back to an 9am to 5pm work day become akin to fighting off jet lag after a long haul flight and your body/brain will need to readjust.

On top of the issues with time management, I know from experience that with the flexibility afforded by working from home, comes the challenges of non-work commitments, such as caring for kids, errands, household tasks and distractions that take your attention away.

The may be an over exaggeration for some, but household tasks is possibly the worst time-suck there is when working from home, its very easy to go downstairs for 2 minutes to make a cup of tea or coffee, and then find you’ve thought, “oh while they kettles boiling i’ll just do this one thing”.. And then all of a sudden you’ve used 45 minutes sweeping the floor, doing the dishes from earlier, rearranging the fridge and fixing that broken hinge on the cupboard door.

The same goes for errands, i’ll just pop down the corner shop to get some milk, that package needs to be posted, i’ll just pop down the post office, I feel like chocolate, and the brand I have in the freezer (yes, the freezer, try it) just won’t cut it today, i’ll just go get some more, while these aren’t as bad as household tasks for taking away your day, they still unexpectedly suck the time away.

Remember if you’re working from home, while you’re working, you’re not home, you’re at work. So you in order to keep your work/life balance solid, you need to respect that and treat it that way.

The best way to keep focus on your work life is to pretend that your home life between the work hours you’ve set for yourself, just isn’t there, almost as if you got up in the morning, got dressed, had breakfast, walked out the door and into the car on the way to work.

I would always apologise at the end of the day for not cleaning, or not doing a vacuum, because i’d be home all day, and on the flip side, i'd often offer to get something done in a break, or say "yes, i'll swap the washing over when i come downstairs" and then because i'd be busy, completely forget to do that, and that is completely fine.

My wife used to remind me, repeatedly, for years, that I wasn’t at home, I was at work, they just happened to be in the same building, and would often stop me before I offered to get something done and remind me that I was supposed to be at work, it took a while but I eventually got into the mindset of saying "no, sorry i'm at work" if i was asked to do something during the day that could distract from that.

I'm not saying that was a rigid rule, occasionally I would find a gap and plan to spend an hour tidying, but 95% of the time, I was at work, and I had to keep it that way to keep myself sane (or as close to sane as one can possibly get)

#### Working with Children about
For those with children, in this current situation and with schools being closed, things like dropping off the kids from school and picking them up isn’t an issue, instead, they’ll most likely be there with you full time, asking questions every five minutes, or asking you to play.

I can’t go too much into how its going to be to care for children while you’re trying to work, because every child is different and my advice would only apply to my children.

Those of you who have older children, they’ll probably just get on with the day and manage themselves... but younger children, who don’t have an appreciation yet for boundaries that may have been put in place, will interrupt at every opportunity… but there are things you can do to minimise the effect of this, and a proper work environment is one of them...
  

#### Your Work Environment

Equal to setting up solid defined work hours and breaks, is making sure that your work environment is setup, equipped and if possible, separated from your home life.

In my 3 years with working from home, I had many work environments, we converted the garage for a while, until a leak developed upstairs and I moved back inside the house, then we stuck a desk in the spare bedroom.

When we got a dog my desk moved down to the kitchen until he was toilet trained.

My daughter lives in Australia with her mum, and we keep a bedroom here for her, when she was in Australia, that room became (and will again become) my office, when she came over here, I setup a desk in my own bedroom to separate myself, i've even had a few stints on the couch.

If you need to more closely supervise kids, such as being in the same room, or working from the kitchen while they play in bedrooms or the lounge room, then isolate yourself with headphones.  If you need silence, get some noise cancelling ones, if you need noise then stick on something non-distracting.

Make it clear, if possible, that while those are on and you're in front of the computer, that you're at work, and try and get children, partners and visitors (although at the moment we shouldn't be having visitors) to respect that.

If you have no one else in the house with you during the day, then there are a lot of options as you won’t be distracted by people, however if you have kids in the house, partners in the house, or other distractions, the best option is always to find a way to physically or virtually separate yourself.

There is no one right way to do it, everyone has different work styles, different ways of doing things.

My wife needs absolute silence when working or she can’t focus, I need noise, whether its music, podcasts or the comforting sound of old Simpsons episodes to properly disconnect from distraction around me.  Although I will stress, make sure it's something non-distracting, I used to assume I could work and listen to TV at the same time, and I can, as long as it's something you've seen or heard before, or something light that you probably wont be paying attention to.  I wasted a few hours over the course of being distracted by episodes of Madam Secretary a couple of years ago, i'd put it on as background noise, and then got myself hooked... 

#### Your Wellbeing - Leaving Work and Going Home
For some, if your laptop is with you when you’re supposed to be officially home, it is really easy to slip into the habit of “oh i’ll just take a look at this one thing”... “i’ll just quickly check my emails” and can easily lead to spending the evenings regularly messing about with work and disrupting that work/life balance.

I’m still guilty of it myself today, I get emails and Teams messages through to my phone, sometimes late on an evening, and I respond, or quickly open the laptop occasionally to look at an issue, perpetuating the cycle.

It’s not so bad when you’re in the office all day and then you pop open the laptop for 10 minutes, but when you’re home all day working, and then you finish working, and then you open up the laptop and continue working, it can quickly become the new normal, as a work force, we must all work together to try an avoid this.  I used to send emails late at night, knowing full well that they wouldn't be seen until the morning because they wouldn't be received until people got back into the office.   

But with a large chunk of the world now working from home, the lines can quickly become blurred, if you aren't expecting a reply until the morning to a message you want to send, then try and leave it until the morning to send it, otherwise with your co-worker also at home, he/she may respond right away, and then your respond to theirs, then you end up chatting about work matters on Teams, and all of a sudden, you're back at work at 9pm at night.

Especially with everyone working from home, there will be a lot more work flowing back and forth through communication channels and not having control of that will quickly show its strain on keeping that balance.

As someone who's spent years not separating my home and work life, and having to learn the hard way how much effect this can have on your mental health, and with the majority of the work force now risking not separating work and home, I believe its of vital importance that we don't introduce and then perpetuate that cycle, and leave work at work, and home at home, even when they are in the same building.
  

The Isolation and the Silence

This was a big one for me, this caused all sorts of issues, I went from a job where I interacted with a dozen people every day face to face, down to a few text messages back and forth with co-workers in London and Harrogate during the day. Some weeks, especially those when kids were at school, i’d spend the majority of my time completely socially isolated.

A lot of people like and need the social aspect of office working to break from the monotony of staring at a computer all day, others require complete isolation to work effectively, we’re all different.


I know that given these current circumstances, thats kinda the point. But not seeing someone face to face and being socially isolated are vastly different beasts. In the office people would catch up in the kitchen and have a chat
