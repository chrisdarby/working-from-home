#### Who am I
My name is Chris Darby, I work in CIS at Durham University as an IS Specialist, I’m one of the people they call when the website has an issue or they need a new whizz-bang app to do something fancy.

I’ve only been with Durham University for a few months, since October 2019, but have been a professional web developer since 1997.

My career has had me working for development studios in both Australia and the UK, and working on everything from small business websites, mobile apps, development for charitable causes, applications and websites for educational institutions such as Murdoch University in Western Australia, and large scale enterprise applications and websites for private corporate clients and government departments and everything in between.

Oh, I also know that I can waffle on, at great length, whether you want me to or not… so my apologies if this is really way too long...


#### Why ( I believe ) I know what i’m talking about

My position previous to coming to the University had me working from home full time for 3 years, when I first started back in September 2016, I saw only the positives, eyes sparkling at the flexibility and freedom I was about to have, the joys of no longer having to commute to work meaning I could sleep that little bit later, however, I didn’t anticipate the challenges that came with working from home full time, my wife did, she warned me, repeatedly, but I didn’t listen.

My wife works in Mental Health with the NHS, she talked to me about routine and keeping a home and work life balance and how to maintain connection and communication with people, but again, I didn’t listen, I was too wrapped up in how great this was going to be and how wonderful it would be for everyone, that I just didn’t fully see what the challenges could be.

I am aware that not everyone is going to have issue with working from home, a lot of you will do quite well, and this document won’t apply to everyone, it may apply to no-one, but i’d wager that many of you, whom have possibly never worked from home, are going to struggle to stay focused, are going to struggle to not get distracted, are going to struggle with potential isolation and loneliness if you’re in the house alone all day, or are going to struggle to keep a routine, I know I did...

Despite spending many years working on freelance projects from home, the occasional afternoon from home and tinkering in the evenings with my own private projects, switching to working from home full time definitely required a lot of unexpected adjustment.

But don’t get me wrong, working home was great, it really was, the flexibility and freedom was amazing, but I won’t sugarcoat it working from home was also very frustrating, draining, and emotionally challenging, my wife will be the first to shout out loud how much of a nightmare I was at times.

So let’s talk about it and discuss some strategies...


#### What working from home is like

For me, it was equal amounts relaxing, isolating, frustrating, lonely, productive and flexible, although this isn’t going to be the case for a lot of people, particularly because when I worked for home, my wife was at work and for the majority of the time the kids were at school, at the moment a lot of you will have kids at home or your partner also working from home.

Working from home gave me a huge amount of flexibility, despite a few teething issues at the start with getting into routine, which we’ll get to later, I could manage the kids and school pickups (not so much an issue at the moment), walk the dog, take a break when I needed, sleep in a little later because there was no commute.

Once I got properly into the swing of things, my productivity massively increased, once I was able to get into routine, I found I could get quite a lot done in my work day, at times completing more than I would in an office and in less time.

As I mentioned, for a lot of people during this pandemic, isolation and loneliness won’t be an issue as kids and spouses will probably also be at home, however the opposite also has its challenges.

Having spent 3 years working from home, it means I was also working from home during school holidays and some days when my wife was at home, taking time off to spend with the kids.

While isolation and loneliness had its drawbacks, equally, kids at home, a full house, arguments from the kids because they’re bouncing off the wall and constant distraction also had a big effect on maintaining that balance.

So, where do I begin…

#### Your work day routine

It is absolutely important, and I cannot stress this enough, it is absolutely one of the most important things, that you set in place a proper work routine, a no-brainer right?

Thats what I thought…

What is necessary, is a proper routine, with a set start and end time, defined breaks, a set lunch time, and a well defined routine. This doesn’t mean make things so rigid that you lock yourself down and end up going nuts.

If you started work in the office at 9am, then start in your home office at 9am

If you finished at 4pm, then finish at 4pm and don’t stray beyond that. If you took lunch at 12:30pm, then stop, step away from the computer and take lunch for an hour at 12:30pm.

Not only does this give your work day structure to work with, but it also means that you don’t end up getting into the non-routine of starting the work day later and later, or finishing earlier than you would normally and end up getting behind in work, or not realising until 3pm that you haven’t had lunch yet because you’ve been focused on a task. Or worst of all, not setting a defined finish time, so you end up still sitting there at 8pm working on just one more report, or tinkering with a bit of code, or trying to solve problems at 10pm, 5 hours after you were supposed to finish.

Getting into that sort of routine, particularly those who are dedicated to finishing a task, can quickly lead to being overworked and burnt out, having your home life suffer and not being able to separate the two. 

Setting in a routine at the start, and sticking to it as best as possible, also massively helps when in a few months time going back into the the office. I know from experience that if you have a routine (or lack thereof) that is out of whack, such as sleeping in late and then working late, or getting busy towards the end of the day and working into the evening, your body really does get used to this work life, and getting back to an 9am to 5pm work day become akin to fighting off jet lag after a long haul flight and your body/brain will need to readjust.

On top of the issues with time management, I know from experience that with the flexibility afforded by working from home, comes the challenges of non-work commitments, such as caring for kids, errands, household tasks and distractions that take your attention away.

The may be an over exaggeration for some, but household tasks is possibly the worst time-suck there is when working from home, its very easy to go downstairs for 2 minutes to make a cup of tea or coffee, and then find you’ve thought, “oh while they kettles boiling i’ll just do this one thing”.. And then all of a sudden you’ve used 45 minutes sweeping the floor, doing the dishes from earlier, rearranging the fridge and fixing that broken hinge on the cupboard door.

The same goes for errands, i’ll just pop down the corner shop to get some milk, that package needs to be posted, i’ll just pop down the post office, I feel like chocolate, and the brand I have in the freezer (yes, the freezer, try it) just won’t cut it today, i’ll just go get some more, while these aren’t as bad as household tasks for taking away your day, they still unexpectedly suck the time away.

Remember if you’re working from home, while you’re working, you’re not home, you’re at work. So you in order to keep your work/life balance solid, you need to respect that and treat it that way.

The best way to keep focus on your work life is to pretend that your home life between the work hours you’ve set for yourself, just isn’t there, almost as if you got up in the morning, got dressed, had breakfast, walked out the door and into the car on the way to work.

I would always apologise at the end of the day for not cleaning, or not doing a vacuum, because i’d be home all day, and on the flip side, i'd often offer to get something done in a break, or say "yes, i'll swap the washing over when i come downstairs" and then because i'd be busy, completely forget to do that, and that is completely fine.

My wife used to remind me, repeatedly, for years, that I wasn’t at home, I was at work, they just happened to be in the same building, and would often stop me before I offered to get something done and remind me that I was supposed to be at work, it took a while but I eventually got into the mindset of saying "no, sorry i'm at work" if i was asked to do something during the day that could distract from that.

I'm not saying that was a rigid rule, occasionally I would find a gap and plan to spend an hour tidying, but 95% of the time, I was at work, and I had to keep it that way to keep myself sane (or as close to sane as one can possibly get)

#### Getting Ready To Go To Work
I found very early on that hopping out of bed last minute, still in pyjamas and jumping on the laptop in my office and starting work ended up being detrimental for me, I got out of my normal life routine very quickly.

Soon, I realised I worked much better, felt much better about myself and was able to keep things balanced if I treated going to work in the morning as if I was actually stepping out the door and going to work.  

I got up at the same time I always would, sometimes half an hour later because I no longer had to catch a bus or do the commute, so I afforded myself a slight sleep in, but I would wake up, shower, get myself dressed, more comfortable clothes than what I might wear to work normally, but still fully dressed.

I would come downstairs, do the normal morning routine, breakfast, walk the dog early, ease into the day and then start work at 8:30am as I normally would at any other job.

I found doing it this way rather than just straight out of bed and onto the computer means that I was able to handle some of those household tasks that got in the way, I was able to be calm, fed and ready for work, I was able to focus better, I was able to separate my work hours and home hours, and just generally felt better about myself as a result.

I didn't always brush my hair properly, well to be fair I sometimes come into the office looking like a scruff too, so that that point is moot, I won't always put on shoes if I wasn't physically leaving the house, sometimes not even socks if it wasn't a cold morning.

Occasionally, very occasionally I allowed myself a CBF pyjama day, but for the vast majority of the time, I kept to a proper morning and finishing routine, and i'll tell you, it really helped!

#### Working with children around you
Full disclosure, for me... it's hard, it turned me for a while into a tyrannical parent until I got a hold on everything and learned to manage things better.

For those with children, in this current situation and with schools being closed, tasks like dropping off the kids from school and picking them up isn’t an issue, instead, they’ll most likely be there with you full time, asking questions every five minutes, or asking you to play, or monologging at you about something while you're in a virtual team meeting.

Those of you who have older children, they’ll probably just get on with the day and manage themselves... but younger children, who don’t have an appreciation yet for boundaries that may have been put in place, will interrupt at every opportunity… 

I can’t go too much into how its going to be to care for your children while you’re trying to work, because every child is different and my advice would only apply to my children, but there are things you can do to minimise the distraction and disruption that children can have, and a proper work environment is one of them...
  

#### Your work environment
Equal to setting up solid defined work hours and breaks, is making sure that your work environment is setup, equipped and if possible, separated from your home life.

In my 3 years with working from home, I had many work environments, we converted the garage for a while, until a leak developed upstairs and I moved back inside the house, then we stuck a desk in the spare bedroom.

When we got a dog my desk moved down to the kitchen until he was toilet trained.

My daughter lives in Australia with her mum, and we keep a bedroom here for her, when she was in Australia, that room became (and will again become) my office, when she came over here, I setup a desk in my own bedroom to separate myself, i've even had a few stints on the couch.

If you need to more closely supervise kids, such as being in the same room, or working from the kitchen while they play in bedrooms or the lounge room, then isolate yourself with headphones.  If you need silence, get some noise cancelling ones, if you need noise then stick on something non-distracting.

Make it clear, if possible, that while those are on and you're in front of the computer, that you're at work, and try and get children, partners and visitors (although at the moment we shouldn't be having visitors) to respect that.

If you have no one else in the house with you during the day, then there are a lot of options as you won’t be distracted by people, however if you have kids in the house, partners in the house, or other distractions, the best option is always to find a way to physically or virtually separate yourself.

There is no one right way to do it, everyone has different work styles, different ways of doing things.

For example, my wife needs absolute silence when working or she can’t focus, I need noise, whether its music, podcasts or the comforting sound of old Simpsons episodes to properly disconnect from distraction around me.  

I will stress, make sure that if you need noise, make sure it's something non-distracting, I used to assume I could work and listen to TV at the same time, and I can, as long as it's something i've seen or heard before, or something light that I probably wont be paying attention to.  

I wasted a few hours at the beginning of my work from home tenure being distracted by episodes of Madam Secretary, i'd put it on as background noise, and then got myself hooked and distracted by the very thing that was supposed to keep me focused... 

#### Working with your partner in the house
Unfortunately (or fortunately) I never encountered issues with this, my wife is front line staff with the NHS so rarely does work at home, but I understand a lot of people need their space or to be able to focus on work without distraction, and my only suggestion in this instance, is again to make sure you setup your own space to work where you can switch off from everything around you.

#### Your wellbeing - Leaving work at work and "going home"
For some, if your laptop is with you when you’re supposed to be officially home, it is really easy to slip into the habit of “oh i’ll just take a look at this one thing”... “i’ll just quickly check my emails” and can easily lead to spending the evenings regularly messing about with work and disrupting that work/life balance.

I’m still guilty of it myself today, I get emails and Teams messages through to my phone, sometimes late on an evening, and I respond, or quickly open the laptop occasionally to look at an issue, perpetuating the cycle.

It’s not so bad when you’re in the office all day and then you pop open the laptop for 10 minutes, but when you’re home all day working, and then you finish working, and then you open up the laptop and continue working, it can quickly become the new normal, as a work force, we must all work together to try an avoid this.  I used to send emails late at night, knowing full well that they wouldn't be seen until the morning because they wouldn't be received until people got back into the office.   

But with a large chunk of the world now working from home, the lines can quickly become blurred, if you aren't expecting a reply until the morning to a message you want to send, then try and leave it until the morning to send it, otherwise with your co-worker also at home, he/she may respond right away, and then your respond to theirs, then you end up chatting about work matters on Teams, and all of a sudden, you're back at work at 9pm at night.

Especially with everyone working from home, there will be a lot more work flowing back and forth through communication channels and not having control of that will quickly show its strain on keeping that balance.

As someone who's spent years not separating my home and work life, and having to learn the hard way how much effect this can have on your mental health, and with the majority of the work force now risking not separating work and home, I believe its of vital importance that we don't introduce and then perpetuate that cycle, and leave work at work, and home at home, even when they are in the same building.
  
#### The Isolation and the Social Silence

This was a big one for me, although I didn't realise it at the start, but this caused all sorts of issues.

I went from a job where I interacted with a dozen people every day face to face, down to a few text messages back and forth with co-workers in London and Harrogate during the day and a team phone call once or twice a week.  I thought this was ok, 

Some weeks, especially those when kids were at school, i’d spend the majority of my time completely socially isolated, not talking to anyone, when my co-workers were off work or on holiday, and it was just me in the "office", it was mentally damaging for me.   I do know some people who would love this isolation, love the silence, time to themselves, but the majority of us are social creatures and need the interaction.

I know that given these current circumstances, social distancing is kinda the point, but not seeing someone face to face and being socially isolated are vastly different beasts. In the office people would catch up in the kitchen and have a chat, pop by each others desks and discuss work and non-work things, and that is good and healthy.

I love getting on with my work, then popping my head over my desk for a few minutes to chat to my my team, have a bit of a laugh and then get back on with it, it breaks up the day, it keeps me sane and makes me enjoy my time in the office, and i'm sure it's the same for a lot of people.

Regular communication, for most people is key to a healthy work lifestyle.

#### Keeping Communication Flowing

In my old job we used Slack for group chats about work (and non-work) and the occasional conference call to discuss work, have out weekly team meetings, solve problems etc, but in that job I was largely self sufficient, I was given a job to do, and I go on with it on my own, there was no real collaboration because my projects were my projects.

Here in the University, we are a very collaborative team, people work and communicate across departments, projects are usually worked on by several people at once, and communication and collaboration is one of the key requirements of the work life here, and that doesn't need to stop just because we are working from home.

To keep communication flowing, regular communication through Teams and email is key, daily team calls about the work going on and just to catch up as you normally would on a morning helps with the isolation, and even better, as someone who has spent 7 years fostering a close and solid relationship with my daughter overseas, group video chats on Teams instead of just audio of via text really does help bridge that distance.

Just make sure you're wearing pants if you have to get up from the desk... 

#### Making Time For You

This is the one single area where I struggled the most, I initially didn't get into a good routine, I tried to take on too much at home while trying to work, I didn't leave the house, and I put no time aside for myself...

For most of us, the commute to work, while always complained about, does give us much needed time or ourselves.  At the moment I have what some people would describe as "a nightmare commute" from my house in Hartlepool to the University, its an hour long bus ride "if" the buses are on time and not packed... sometimes it can be an hour and a half... but that hour and a half for me is very relaxing, I stick on some headphones, i'm out of the house, there is a clear separation between work and home and I spend an hour easing into my day.  

I imagine its the same for a lot of people, even those who drive in, sometimes just that 20 minutes in the car with the radio on, separating yourself from home on your way to work gives your brain a clear boundary between work an home.

When you're at home all the time, and especially at the moment when there isn't much option outside of home, it can have a very detrimental effect if you don't manage it.

By the end of most days, I was so frazzled and tense after being isolated in the house all day, and finishing work and still being in the house, that I would look forward to popping to ASDA for a loaf of bread (if they haven't all be bought by panic buyers) just to have a reason to get out of the house.

By the end of it, my wife was practically pushing me out of the house when she got home so I had some time to wind down before rejoining the family, I spent over a year not making time for myself, and at the same time not realising I wasn't making time for myself and it caused serious mental stress.

I started to finish my work day by locking myself away from work and family for half an hour to play guitar, or watch an episode of TV by myself, or i'd walk the dog, or go to the shops and take my sweet time buying one thing, just to get out and reset before coming back.

At the moment pubs are closed, shops are closed, gyms and pools are closed, and options for getting out of the house and going somewhere are very slim pickings, so its even more vitally important that you identify that disconnect between work life and home life and give yourself time to reset and recharge by putting aside planned, guilt free time for yourself to do something you like, and something that relaxes you, and encourage your partner to do the same.

I ended up (much to my shame) taking my frustrations out on the kids, on my wife, being short with people because I didn't recognise what was going on with me, I didn't know at the time why I was tense, upset, burnt out and stressed... I was working from home, its supposed to be the dream, but if not done properly, its the complete opposite, so make time for you, every day!

#### Don’t Become Sedentary
Oh my god, this one came along and bit me without realising it.  My job before working from home and my job now includes a commute, that commute includes at least an hour of walking each day.

I'd walk to the bus stop, do the bus ride, then 15-20 minutes walking to my desk, more at the University thanks to that pain in the arse hill! 

I went from getting 20-30 mins of exercise each morning and afternoon on my commute and another 20-30 mins during the day with my coworkers walking to get lunch, to being mostly sedentary inside the house, it made me lazy, I got unfit (more-so), and once I started working again, realised that i'd actually injured myself as a result of my non-movement.

A result of my 3 years of working from home has left me with both achilles tendons damaged from regular non-use, going from very little walking during the week to 30 mins each way of moderate activity walking to work has left me with damage that i didn't expect, and left me far more unfit than I used to be.  Co-workers in CIS will often see me limping too and fro until my tendons have warmed up, its taken me 6 months to go from a painful limp, to a slightly less painful limp.

Aside from dealing with routine, social isolation and distraction, don't neglect your health as a by-product.  I plan in this next 3 months to each day get out for a walk, or spend 25 minutes doing some sort of video based exercise routine, just to not get back into that sedentary lifestyle.

Especially with gyms and fitness centres closed, and people being urged not to get out and mingle, its more important now that proper plans are made to keep yourself fit and healthy,

#### Final Thoughts
Working from home is a great opportunity, but also has a lot of drawbacks and gotchas if you don't plan properly...

I don't have all the answers and this is purely from my own experience.

Hopefully it's helpful to some.
